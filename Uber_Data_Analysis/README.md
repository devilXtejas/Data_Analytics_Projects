## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed hidden spaces from column names
- Converted `Date` and `Time` columns to proper datetime formats
- Handled missing values (dropped nulls in critical columns, filled numeric columns with median)
- Standardized categorical variables (strip + title case)

### 2️⃣ Descriptive Analysis
- Most and least popular vehicle types
- Average ride distance and booking value
- Distribution of driver and customer ratings
- Most common cancellation reasons (by customer and driver)

### 3️⃣ Customer Behavior Insights
- Frequent cancellers by Customer ID
- Cancellation patterns by time of day and day of week
- Correlation between ride value, distance, and customer satisfaction

### 4️⃣ Driver Performance Evaluation
- Highest, lowest, and average driver ratings
- Driver cancellation count and reasons

### 5️⃣ Operational Metrics
- Average VTAT and CTAT across vehicle types
- Peak demand pickup and drop locations
- Peak demand time slots
